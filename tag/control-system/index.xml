      <description>&lt;p&gt;I constructed a control system for a companion, designed to monitor and control the curing process involved in creating carbon products or conducting repairs. The compact control system is compactly housed in a Peli Case, as shown in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While featuring a minimal physical interface, the system offers extensive monitoring, configuration, and control capabilities wirelessly through an application accessible on a phone, tablet, or PC. The primary objective of this control system is to measure and control the vacuum and temperature. To achieve this, the system incorporates a vacuum and thermocouple sensor, and has two relays to control a regular vacuum pump and a heating element within a 2x2kW limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure safety, the system incorporates protective features against overcurrent and overheating. Additionally, it provides warning/error signals in the event of unintended behavior, such as a leaking vacuum or a malfunctioning heating element.&lt;/p&gt;
