      <title>Drone piloting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past years, I&amp;rsquo;ve regularly piloted drones. Since 2022, I own a DJI Mini 2 drone which I fly for hobby photography/videography outdoors and occasionally from a boat at sea. Sometimes I assist friends or family with drone inspections, such as roof assessments, and orthomosaic mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my Masters, I piloted prototype drones daily for test flights and calibrations. These drones were designed for autonomous flight, and I served as a safety pilot to intervene if needed. Working on the drones, and these piloting experiences deepened my understanding of drone components and sensors and their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On special occasions, I piloted other drones, like a DJI Mavic 3 during the Xprize Rainforest Competition in 2023, flying BVLOS in the jungle for close-up images of the vegetation. As of January 2024, my logged flights are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DJI Mini 2: 188 flights, 18h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parrot bebop 2: 90+ flights, 40+h (autonomous drone prototype)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DJI Mavic 3 pro: 8 flights, 4h (BVLOS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DJI Tello: 30+ flights, 5+h (autonomous drone prototype)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eachine Trashcan: 40+ flights, 8+h (FPV practice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flyablitiy Helios 2: 1 flight, 10min (tryout/pilot-training)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>3D printing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the start of my HBO Mechatronics studies, my interest in 3D printing has grown, leading to significant learning experiences. Over the past 7 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve delved into various aspects, such as optimizing material-print settings and mastering 3D design in Solidworks for lightweight, strong, and durable prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my HBO study projects, I designed numerous parts and small-scale machines in Solidworks, translating these designs into 3D-printed realities. During my first internship, I revived an old and mallfunctioning Ultimaker Original, one of the pioneers in consumer 3D printers, from 2011. Over time, I enhanced its capabilities by modifying electronics, creating a new hotend and adding a heated bed. The printer is shown in the image at the top of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five years, I decided to upgrade to the Creality Ender 3 S1 for a quieter and more precise printing experience. This printer automates many calibrations and fine-tuning processes, minimizing the need for manual adjustments and ensuring smoother prints, especially with its acceleration sensor for automatic tuning and reduced vibrations at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my 3D printing journey, printing on avarage roughly two parts per week, I have actively engaged in designing, printing, and refining. This hands-on approach has provided valuable insights into material properties and additive manufacturing processes. I now have a comprehensive understanding of selecting materials based on factors like durability, sun exposure, chemical requirements, and brittleness. Additionally, for the part design, the layer-by-layer printing process has taught me to consider factors such as layer orientation for strength, the necessity of support structures, and the precision required for achieving strength, lightweightness, and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
